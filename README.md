I thought it would be fun to test out some packages and learn some stats along the way.

On the visualization side, there's some cool packages I've been meaning to try out. At a low-level Seaborn looks like a cool wrapper for matplotlib. There's also bokeh and plotly if you think interactivity would be cool. For the big guns, I might stretch to D3.js which I'm really excited about.
