I thought it would be fun to test out some packages and learn some stats along the way. I found a good bit of data from the Cook County Assessor's Office [here](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Cook-County-Assessor-s-Residential-Sales-Data/5pge-nu6u).

On the stats side, I wanted to introduce myself to models and methods for building models. The first one I wanted to look at was step-wise regression. I know it's got problems, especially as data grow, but I think it would be really cool to make a few different models and test them against one another.

On the visualization side, there's some cool packages I've been meaning to try out. At a low-level Seaborn looks like a cool wrapper for matplotlib. There's also bokeh and plotly if you think interactivity would be cool. For the big guns we could even look at D3.js which I'm really excited about.
